# Basics

“Dialogue is indented, and in double quotation. If the line is followed by an attribution tag, end the line with a comma,” Jane said.

“Whenever there’s a new speaker, begin a new indented paragraph,” Jake replied. “If the same speaker continues with a new sentence, end the tag with a period and capitalize the next sentence of dialogue.”

“If the tag is placed within a sentence,” Jane said, “use a comma after the attribution tag. It’s a good idea to put the tag as close to the beginning of the sentence as possible, to avoid confusion”

“If there’s an action after the dialogue, end the line with a period.” Jake raised a cautioning finger. “Note that the next line of dialogue begins with a capital letter.” 
He indicated the black board. “As long as actions and lines of dialogue are performed by the same character, there’s no need for a new paragraph.”

“This line is spoken by someone else and is in a new paragraph, with a tag,” Jane added.

Jake coughed. “If the paragraph includes an action before or after the line of dialogue, the tag is unnecessary.”

# Interruptions & Volume

“When a speaker is suddenly cut off, use an em ma—” Jane began.

“What if the first speaker continues after the interruption?” Jake interjected.

“—rk. Lead in with another em mark if the line continues.”

“I can interrupt myself,” — Jane smiled wide and indicated herself with both thumbs — “if I want to. In that case, use em-dashes around the action beat.”

“Voices that trail off end with an ellipsis…” Jake said.

“Interruptions, even if they’re short, help break up long speeches from a single character.”

“I see,” Jakes said.

“You, betcha. You’d end up with massive blocks of monologue otherwise, especially if one of the characters is a windbag that constantly spews exposition.”

“You don’t say.”

*Jane nodded. Thoughts are indicated with italics. There’s no tag because we can only hear the thoughts of the point of view character. I won’t tell Jake though, he’s clearly fed up with me.

“What if I want to shout or whisper?” Jake said.

“Use an exclamation point!” Jane screamed. “Exotic tags are still best avoided, but tags that indicate volume are an exception! They’re hard to do any other way! Shouted, whispered, bellowed and so on! If you want to emphasise a certain word, use *italics*!”

“Yes, thank you,” John muttered. “I would have understood without the demonstration.”


# Attribution tags frequency

Whenever an attribution tag can be omitted, it should be omitted.

“This is a new line,” Jane said. “It has to have a tag because it’s not attributed.”

“So does this,” Jake said, “because I’m a new speaker.”

“This doesn’t, because it’s a dialogue between two people, and it’s understood the first speaker is speaking again.”

“This continues until something interrupts the exchange.”

At the end of the table, John looked up from The Elements of Style. “What if there are more than two speakers?”

“Then tags have to be used more often, but should still be omitted whenever possible.”

Jane stood up and straightened her skirt. “The use of actions instead of tags is especially important in conversations between more than two speakers. So remember to include them.”

Jake applauded. “That’s a great idea!”

“I think so too,” John nodded in agreement.

Jake spoke up. “Hey, Jane? Is it true that you can omit the tag when the line of dialogue itself tells the reader who the speaker is?”

“That’s true Jake. Don’t you agree John?”

“I certainly do.”

# Action beats

Jane nodded. “Action beats are almost always a better choice than tags, because they don’t change the tone of the line itself, just the context.”

Jake snorted. “Don’t overuse them though.” He crossed his arms. “You’ll end up with characters just flailing about.” He put his hands on his hips and tapped his foot.”Actions must make sense in the scene, and add something to it.”

Jane noticed a drop of sweat on Jake’s forehead. He’d worked himself up quite a bit over this. “You’re right,” she said. “You look ridiculous.” She put an affectionate arm around him. “Action beats doesn’t have to be actions, you know. They can just as easily be observations, that show perspective and mood.” She smiled when Jake's sullen demeanor dissipated. “Only for the point of view character, of course.”

Jake nodded and slipped his arm around Jane’s waist. “You’re right. You’re always right. They’re still better than adverbs though.”

"You bet," Jane said. "Exotic tags and adverbs that modify the line of dialogue itself forces the reader to rethink what they just read, and it can make things confusing or even contradictory."

"You're right about that," Jake quipped angrily. "We want the reader to be always moving forward when reading, like a shark. That’s why we use neutral tags."
