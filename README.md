# Arre Writing Helpers

Obsidian vault containing helpful resources for writers. It's a very early version, so assume everything can change.
It is being made with the help of ChatGPT, so it's currently semi-curated.

## How to use

First you need Obsidian app - very good piece of software for building knowledge bases. Check their terms and conditions, and if you are ok with them, download the app.

After you have the app, you need to download this repo.
Find the `Code` button(closer to the top of the page). You will find there a few ways to get the repo.
The easies way is to just download the .zip file, and unpack it.
The better way is to use `git`. Find a tutorial on how to use it and clone the repo.

After you have the repo on your computer, open the `ArreWritingHelpers` directory as a vault in Obsidian app.

## Updating

If you opted for easier way, you will pay for it now as you have to manually downloand new .zip file with the new version every time.
If you chose git route, just run `git pull` command to get the most recent repo version in place.

## Contributing

You feel like you would want to add something? Have an unbearable itch about some typo? Or maybe you just want to improve consistency of exisiting texts?
I am open to contributions. Learn how to make a pull request and send the changes my way. I will review them, and if I like them they will be added to the vault.
